# Hi, I’m Naga Pranathi 👋  
### CSE Student | ML & Full-Stack Enthusiast | Product-Minded Builder

I’m a Computer Science Engineering student who learns best by **building real things**.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of **machine learning, backend systems, and user-centric design** — with a strong focus on **efficiency, explainability, and practicality**.

I’m not into over-engineering.  
If something doesn’t work, I’m okay killing it and shipping a better version 🚀

## 🚀 Major Projects

### 🔐 Phishing Detection System (Core Project)
**End-to-end, resource-efficient, explainable ML system**

**Domains covered:**
- 📩 SMS  
- 📧 Email  
- 🌐 URLs  
- 🖼️ Images (via OCR)

**Key Highlights:**
- Fine-tuned **6–7 lightweight ML models**
- Built **ensemble logic**:
  - Probability averaging
  - Final label decision (PHISHING vs LEGITIMATE)
- Focused on:
  - Small model size
  - Low inference time
  - Deployment feasibility
- Integrated **LIME** for explainability:
  - Highlighted phishing-related words
- Designed a **Gradio UI**:
  - Text input
  - Image upload → OCR
  - Prediction + explanation output
- Research-ready:
  - Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Loss)
  - LaTeX tables
  - Model efficiency comparison

📌 This project is **interview-ready and research-ready**.

### ♟️ Chess AI System
- CNN-based chess move prediction (`chess_model.h5`)
- `move_to_int` model integration
- **Stockfish** for move validation
- Input: chessboard image  
- Output: predicted move + visual board
- Planned integration with **Rasa chatbot** for AI vs AI play

---

### 🔮 Crypto Price Prediction
- LSTM-based time-series forecasting
- Flask web interface
- Full pipeline: data → model → UI

---

### 🖥️ Editable Desktop Wallpaper (Product-Style Project)
A minimal, always-visible **habit & task system as a desktop wallpaper**.

**What I built:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Dynamic habit list rendering
- Add / remove habits
- Font & UI experimentation
- Local data persistence
- Pivoted from complex inline editing → **simpler menu-based UX**

📌 This project reflects my **product mindset** — simplifying when complexity hurts usability.

---

## 🧠 How I Think (Dev Style)
- Prefer **simple, working systems**
- Kill bad ideas early, iterate fast
- Care about **UX + aesthetics**, not just logic
- Build first, optimize later
